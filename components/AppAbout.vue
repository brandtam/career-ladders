      Career Ladders are a starting point where expectations for a given
      position can be clearly communicated and agreed upon. These ladders are
      meant to provide general guidance when an individual is unsure if they are
      fulfilling expectations of their current postion as well as providing
      insight as they look forward to their next step. Expectations should be
      general and "approach" driven helping to define behavior and motivation
      for a given position.

      Please consider making some changes depending on your org or department in
      particular, we don't have to all be the same, and probably shouldn't be.
